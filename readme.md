# Devcon VI Wiki README

Welcome to the Devcon VI wiki! This is a place to collect all the information about Devcon VI. It is a community effort, so please contribute!

This year there were 444 speakers, so, if you are planning to catch-up on all the talks, even if it is just for one of the tracks it could take a while. So, many of us might have already taken notes of talks or workshops, or are now catching-up on some talks. So here is a place where you can just add your notes and share them with the community. We welcome speakers to review and contribute to the notes as well as linking to their slides. 

There were many great side-events during Devcon, so feel free to add notes from those as well.

> Please keep in mind that we are still working on most of the notes to improve them.  

## How to contribute

If you have notes from a talk or workshop, please add them to the wiki. You can do this in two ways:

1. If you are familiar with GitHub, fork [this repository](https://github.com/xdaluca/devconwiki) and create a pull request to add your notes or make changes to the wiki. 
2. If you are not certain how to do this, please [create an issue](https://github.com/xdaluca/devconwiki/issues/new) in this repository, and we will add your notes to the wiki.

Our goal is to maintain a high level of neutrality and accuracy in the notes. We welcome speakers to review and contribute to the notes as well as linking to their slides. Our aim is to have notes verified by speakers, for this we ask speakers to review the note, raise issues if they find any errors. After the go-ahead of the speaker we will add the "verified by speaker ‚úÖ" to the note.  

For now the editing is done by [@daluca](https://twitter.com/daluca_) and [@THCatarino](https://twitter.com/CatarinoThi), if you want to get involved please reach out.

Check the [Foam Editor Configurations]() if you want to have all the [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/) features enabled in VScode.  

## Statuses
Notes can have the following statuses:
- Draft üìù - The note is still a draft or fleeting note.
- Edited ‚úîÔ∏è - The note has been edited and contains the full contents of the talk.
- Verified by speaker ‚úÖ - The note has been verified by the speaker.
