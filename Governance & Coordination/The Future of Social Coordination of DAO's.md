Description:  
TL;DR DCapp build tools to make it easy for projects to align the incentives of all stakeholders (community, VC's, team members, users etc etc). The direction of the talk will be to talk through the lessons they learnt, how other DAO's and teams can take the success stories to their own projects and give an overview of the aspects of what did that worked. This talk will also go through the experience that have not worked and a critical view of why they did not.  

# Talk Notes  
Chandler's initial talk poses two core questions:   

1. Why do we need DAOs?; 
2. Why do we need to make them better?   

-  The DAO Life cycle: 
   1. DAO is created:
		Excitement: participation are high, contributions are high.
	2. DAO operates: 
		Thing get hard: Effective talent get frustrated and leave. Medium Level Participation.
	3. DAO explodes:
		Talent drained: diverging power dynamics, in-fighting, only few players. Low-level participation, extrinsically motivated.  

- The Things that don't work
	- In monolithic DAO contribution are suboptimal
		- Participation is not the same as contribution
	- #TokenRewards and #DistributionMethods are not effective in #KeepingTalent 
		- #LiquidityMining does not create #AlignedMissionGoals
		- #AirdropFarming
		- #RewardsMaximising Aligned incentives to maximise community value and growth
				- #GrantScrapping
- The things that do work 
	- Labs foundation that works on a #ProtocolModel
		- Highly skilled team
		- Compensated
		- both Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations
	- Small, highly motivated team squads working in specific problem, mainly intrinsic
		- e.g. ImpactDAO's
		- Community Org
		- Verifiable Credentials
